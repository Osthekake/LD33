# LD 33 To Do List

## Add tasks, times, requirements etc as we work them out. Project management, y'all. We need some.

* ~~Decide on a desired user experience. **difficult** *blocker*~~
  - ~~What should appear on screen. *blocker*~~
  - ~~What should a user do to advance the game. *blocker*~~
    - ~~Not actually necessarily important for first simple implementation.~~
  - ~~What should cause pictures to appear? Sounds to play? ~~
    - ~~Not actually necessarily important for first simple implementation.~~
  - ~~Resolve on-going discussion re countdown and/or points. **difficult**~~
    - ~~Not actually necessarily important for first simple implementation.~~
* Overarching story. *blocker*
  - ~~Agree on a basic story to be fleshed out later. *blocker*~~
  - Top-down! If we are going to co-write a story, we need to know explicitly where it should go. **difficult**
    - ~~Decide on major events. (demons) *blocker*~~
    - Decide what it all means. The point we want to get across. (Don't leave it off to the end.)
    - Extend the individual story pieces in interesting ways. *fun*
    - Don't assume that all random pieces of story will fall into place. 
      - Esoteric story is okay
    - Normally it's okay to throw away pieces that don't fit, but we have time requirements. **difficult**
  - Split into segments, different people can flesh out different segments.
    - Test segments in the game!! **simple**
    - Go over segments other people made, discuss. *fun*
  - Start simple, flesh out evenly. Spend equal amount of time on all parts of the story. **difficult**
  - Set aside time for polish, testing, rearranging, rewriting.
  - Polish, polish, polish.
* Game shell. *blocker*
  - ~~Decide on technology. (JS/HTML?)~~
  - ~~Make simplest usable implementation. No fancy graphics or effects, just make something playable that story can be implemented in. <span class="medium">*blocker*</span>~~
  - Then make win/loss condition. *important*
  - ~~Make stuff to show pictures.~~
  - Make stuff to play sounds.
  - Set aside a lot of time for smooth effects etc. Polish is important. *fun*
* Graphic design things.
  - Find a colour scheme, create buttons, decide on fonts.
  - Decide on the kind of "lines" we want.
  - Animate?
* Pictures. **simple**
  - Pick pictures that go with the story, alternatively, draw some. *fun*
  - Make sure they're free to use and don't breach copyright.
  - Make a note of where we got each picture. We should put it in our credits.
* Sounds. **simple**
  - Per picture, or in any other arrangement we like.
  - See pictures.
* Food, water, regular breaks, sleep. All important.

Github markdown doesn't like my css. :'(
