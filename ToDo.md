# LD 33 To Do List

Add tasks, times, requirements etc as we work them out. Project management, y'all. We need some.

* Decide on a desired user experience. **difficult** *blocker*
  - What should appear on screen. *blocker*
  - What should a user do to advance the game. *blocker*
  - Resolve on-going discussion re countdown and/or points. ASAP. **difficult**
    - Not actually necessarily important for first simple implementation.
* Overarching story. *blocker*
  - Agree on a basic story to be fleshed out later. *blocker*
  - Top-down! If we are going to co-write a story, we need to know explicitly where it should go. **difficult**
    - Decide on major events. (demons)
    - Decide what it all means.
    - Extend the individual pieces in interesting ways.
    - Don't assume that random pieces will fall into place. 
    - Normally it's okay to throw away pieces that don't fit, but we have time requirements.
  - Split into segments, different people can flesh out different segments.
    - Test segments in the game!! 
    - Go over segments other people made, discuss.
  - Start simple, flesh out evenly. Spend equal amount of time on all parts of the story. **difficult**
  - Set aside time for polish, testing, rearranging, rewriting.
  - Polish, polish, polish.
* Game shell. *blocker*
  - Decide on technology. (JS/HTML?)
  - Make simplest usable implementation. No fancy graphics or effects, just make something playable that story can be implemented in. *blocker*
  - Then make win/loss condition. 
  - Make stuff to show pictures.
  - Make stuff to play sounds.
  - Set aside a lot of time for smooth effects etc. Polish is important. **difficult**
* Pictures. **simple**
  - Make sure they're free to use and don't breach copyright.
  - Make a note of where we got each picture. We should put it in our credits.
* Sounds. Per pictures. **simple**
  - See pictures.
* Food, water, regular breaks, sleep. All important.
