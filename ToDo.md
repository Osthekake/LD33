# LD 33 To Do List

Add tasks, times, requirements etc as we work them out. Project management, y'all. We need some.

* Decide on a desired user experience. <span class="bad">**difficult**</span> <span class="medium">*blocker*</span>
  - What should appear on screen. <span class="medium">*blocker*</span>
  - What should a user do to advance the game. <span class="medium">*blocker*</span>
  - What should cause pictures to appear? Sounds to play? 
  - Resolve on-going discussion re countdown and/or points. <span class="bad">**difficult**</span>
    - Not actually necessarily important for first simple implementation.
* Overarching story. <span class="medium">*blocker*</span>
  - Agree on a basic story to be fleshed out later. <span class="medium">*blocker*</span>
  - Top-down! If we are going to co-write a story, we need to know explicitly where it should go. <span class="bad">**difficult**</span>
    - Decide on major events. (demons) <span class="medium">*blocker*</span>
    - Decide what it all means. The point we want to get across. (Don't leave it off to the end.)
    - Extend the individual story pieces in interesting ways. <span class="good">*fun*</span>
    - Don't assume that all random pieces of story will fall into place. 
      - Esoteric story is okay though...
    - Normally it's okay to throw away pieces that don't fit, but we have time requirements. <span class="bad">**difficult**</span>
  - Split into segments, different people can flesh out different segments.
    - Test segments in the game!! <span class="good">**simple**</span>
    - Go over segments other people made, discuss. <span class="good">*fun*</span>
  - Start simple, flesh out evenly. Spend equal amount of time on all parts of the story. <span class="bad">**difficult**</span>
  - Set aside time for polish, testing, rearranging, rewriting.
  - Polish, polish, polish.
* Game shell. <span class="medium">*blocker*</span>
  - Decide on technology. (JS/HTML?)
  - Make simplest usable implementation. No fancy graphics or effects, just make something playable that story can be implemented in. <span class="medium">*blocker*</span>
  - Then make win/loss condition. <span class="good">*important*</span>
  - Make stuff to show pictures.
  - Make stuff to play sounds.
  - Set aside a lot of time for smooth effects etc. Polish is important. <span class="good">*fun*</span>
* Pictures. <span class="good">**simple**</span>
  - Pick pictures that go with the story, alternatively, draw some. <span class="good">*fun*</span>
  - Make sure they're free to use and don't breach copyright.
  - Make a note of where we got each picture. We should put it in our credits.
* Sounds. <span class="good">**simple**</span>
  - Per picture, or in any other arrangement we like.
  - See pictures.
* Food, water, regular breaks, sleep. All important.
